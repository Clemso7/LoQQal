LoQQal is delivery web app

LoQQal is delivery web app Loqqal is a web app I developped for my delivery business. 
it allows my clients to make delivery requests for their customers. 
Also, it allows my clients to follow their delivery request status on their personal dashboad. 
When my clients make delivery requests, their customers receive a notification by email. 
The email contains the id package for tracking. 
The app is set up to send the invoices at the clients at a particular day they have chosen. So for example, if the client chooses every saturday, the app will send the invoice on that day. 
This app is built in Django/python, JavaScripst, HTML and CSS. The authentication system integrates email checking. 
The app is translated in two languages: English and french. Also, i integrated Google map autocomplete in the request form. See the web app at : https://www.loqqal.ca/en/ .
